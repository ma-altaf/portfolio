                    Developed a website for mehndi artist, Shifa. This was my
                    first web project and I bite off more than I could chew,
                    implementing a booking system that would be more of pain
                    than a solution. Moreover, I used firebase Web version 8
                    (first time without following a project tutorial) to
                    implement the backend and it will be deprecated. Developed
                    using HTML, CSS(SCSS) and JavaScript, with GSAP library for
                    animation and firebase for the backend.

                        Users can place an appointment on the website itself.

                        number pattern is allowed, moreover when selecting the
                        time if the time slot is black then it is already
                        booked/cannot be booked. If a user already has an
                        appointment, they will not be able to place another one
                        until either their previous appointment is done, or they
                        wait for 3 hours before opting out of the appointment,
                        this was setup as such to block spamming appointments.
