                    Developed website to showcase the previous paintings for the
                    artist, Shifa. Developed using HTML, CSS(SCSS) and
                    JavaScript. Moreover, GSAP library was used for the
                    animations, Imagekit.io for image storage, compression and
                    delivery and the project was hosted using firebase hosting.

                        During the cover page the URLs for the images on
                        Imagekit.io is received and the first 3 images under
                        previous works are downloaded. Using PreloadJs the
                        progress of downloading the images is tracked and the
                        progress bar is updated accordingly. Once the 3 images
                        are downloaded the cover is animated out.

                        Since there are multiple images to be displayed, I
                        decided to use Imagekit.io to reduce the file size of
                        the images as well as adapting it to the screen size of
                        the user, to further reduce the file size if possible.
                        Moreover, I used lazy loading to only download images
                        that are about to be viewed. The lazy loading feature
                        can be seen by looking at the size of the scroll thumb
                        reducing in size every 2 images, as 2 more images are
                        being added to the DOM.

                        The image can be viewed and zoomed into as shown in the
                        video. Since there is no other interaction, the user can
                        leave that page either by clicking anywhere on the
                        screen, or by clicking the back/previous button
                        especially on mobile phone. That “page” is not actually
                        a different one (no visual change to the URL), I used
                        push state to add an entry into the browser's session
                        history stack so that the browser's previous button
                        behaviour would only close that “page” instead of the
                        leaving the webpage.

                        to help the user know that they are interactive. I also
                        added the contact email as a text so that the user can
                        copy the email in case, they have issues with the
                        “mailto:” functionality or they want to use a different
                        emailing software.
